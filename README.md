# Captcha-recognition  
   
Captcha is Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. Captchas are used to make sure that web applications that are supposed to be used by humans are not used by bots or artificial intelligent agents. The design proposes a successful approach to decipher text image-based captchas using image-processing and neural networks. Segmentation of the characters is based on bounding box technique and histogram-based segmentation. The neural network is trained using the Back-Propagation algorithm.
